My name is Monty, and I've got an offer for you!*' You raise an eyebrow. He continues. '*You see... I've got three treasure chests here. In one of them, there's a stack of gold coins. In the others, there's nothing! Pick the right one, and I'll give you the gold!*'\nYou raise your eyebrow higher. Monty keeps speaking, quickly: '*Don't you worry, there's no cost to play. I just get such a kick out of little games like this!*'\nSighing, you pick a treasure chest at random.\nMonty grins. He opens one of the chests you didn't pick. '*Look, there's nothing in this one. Guess you still have a chance! Still feeling lucky about your choice? Or would you rather switch?*''"
