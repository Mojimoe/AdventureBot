text: "Here, you find a book in a glass case. The thin volume is labeled 'The adventurer almanac'. You open the case and withdraw it gently. You open the book, and it flips to a page that bears your smiling face! Beneath it are a series of numbers:"
sequence:
  - text: "\n*Strength: "
    pytext: "str(player.strength) + '*'"
  - text: "\n*Dexterity: "
    pytext: "str(player.dexterity) + '*'"
  - text: "\n*Intellect: "
    pytext: "str(player.intellect) + '*'"
  - text: "\n*Charisma: "
    pytext: "str(player.charisma) + '*'"
  - text: "\n*Alignment: "
    pytext: "player.alignment + '*'"
  - text: "\n*Star Sign: "
    pytext: "player.horoscope + '*'"
  - text: "\nYou gasp and recoil, dropping the almanac. That... can't be right, can it? You leave the room, feeling shaken."
